# Fleet Net Development Task List

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Setup and Structure
- Created directory structure:
    - `server/` - Node.js server code
    - `client/` - Electron client code
    - `shared/` - Shared code between server and client
    - `tests/` - Test directories (unit, integration, e2e)
- Initialized npm project
- Created git repository with appropriate .gitignore files

### 2. Testing Framework Setup
- Installed Jest testing framework with TypeScript support
- Configured Jest for multi-project setup:
    - Server tests (Node environment)
    - Client main process tests (Node environment)
    - Client renderer tests (JSDOM environment)
    - Shared module tests (Node environment)
- Installed testing dependencies:
    - jest, @types/jest, ts-jest
    - jest-environment-node, jest-environment-jsdom
- Created and verified first test (packet.test.ts)

### 3. TypeScript Configuration
- Set up TypeScript with appropriate configs for each module
- Created base configuration (tsconfig.base.json)
- Created module-specific configs:
    - server/tsconfig.json (CommonJS for Node.js)
    - client/tsconfig.json (CommonJS for Electron)
    - shared/tsconfig.json (CommonJS, with declarations)
- Configured build and development scripts

### 4. First Module Implementation
- Created shared packet structure (shared/packet.ts)
- Implemented AudioPacket interface following specification
- Created createAudioPacket function
- Wrote comprehensive tests following TDD approach

### 5. TCP Server Implementation
- Implemented TcpServer class extending EventEmitter
- Added connection handling with unique session IDs
- Implemented client tracking and management
- Created comprehensive unit tests (tests/unit/server/network/tcp-server.test.ts)
- Created integration tests (tests/integration/server/tcp-integration.test.ts)
- Server features:
    - Listen on configurable port
    - Accept multiple client connections
    - Generate unique session IDs using crypto
    - Track connected clients
    - Graceful shutdown with client cleanup

## üöß In Progress

## üìù Notes

- Using TDD approach: Write tests first, then implementation
- Each milestone should produce testable, runnable features
- Focus on MVP - avoid over-engineering early features
